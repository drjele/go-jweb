# Jweb

This is a **Symfony**(https://symfony.com/) inspired framework, written in Go.

It is a work in progress and any contributions are welcomed.

## Todo
* bundle mechanism
* yaml config files and separate config files for each module
* do not activate http or cli if the env params are not set
* add default mode to .env
